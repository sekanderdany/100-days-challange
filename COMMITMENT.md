# 100 Days Challenge

Today is **December 28, 2025**, and right now it’s **7:01 AM** as I finish writing this.  
Maybe I’ll edit it again in the future.

This is **not the beginning** of this repo.  
It’s somewhere in the **middle of the progress**.

When I began this challenge, I thought it would be just another New Year’s resolution—something I *wanted* to keep up, starting with **100 Days of Code in Python**. But it turns out my thought process has changed a lot over the year.

I understand now that it’s not about a year.  
Not even months, weeks, or days.  
It’s about **how you move toward the goal you’re heading for**.

Sometimes big challenges come your way—work, life, frustration, lack of motivation, or even negative energy from people or situations trying to keep you down. But you have to try again. Just **one more step**.

One of my biggest challenges has always been **sticking to one thing**. And trust me, I’ve tried—over many years. For example, I started learning Python in **2017**, and for a very long time I was still stuck understanding variables. I couldn’t even reach the point of making a simple project.

That’s when I realized something important:  
I’m not different from most people.  
I’m not special.  
Just an ordinary guy who wants to try things, fail, get lost for long periods of time, and sometimes never come back.

## This Time Is Different (Maybe)

This time, I have a completely separate goal.  
Or maybe not 😄

The goal is to - **fail and get lost forever.**  
Haha, **just kidding**.

But seriously—I **will** fail.  
Every day.  
Consistently.

I’ll give up.  
I’ll get frustrated.  
I’ll feel overwhelmed.

But the one thing that will **not** repeat is this:  
> **Getting lost in time and never coming back.**

Because this time, I’ll come back.

Maybe I’ll lose all my progress and have to start again from a big zero **(0)**. And that’s okay. Life isn’t about achieving everything. It’s about being happy with what you have.

The most annoying thing for me is looking back and trying to remember what I’ve done over the years—only to realize that I’ve done a lot, but it’s all **messy, scattered, distracted, and unstructured**. Every time I tried to organize it, I got stuck at around **15–20% progress**, never more than that.

## A New Commitment (That Actually Works for Me)

So what commitment did I change this year that might actually work?

Yes—I first allowed myself to be overwhelmed again.  
Calm down 😅

I know this is the part where people walk away and say,  
> “This kid will never learn how to learn. Just stick to one thing, finish it, and move on. That’s what the top 1% people do. Bipidi bapadi boo.”

I understand that approach.  
I just **can’t** do it.

And it’s not just me.

Whenever I set a strict timeline, I fail. I procrastinate. I set a year to learn Python, and when December comes, I’m still in the same place.

So yes—I started again.

And maybe, just maybe (not guaranteed), I won’t finish by **December 2026**. But I’ll be happy with whatever progress I’ve made over the year.

This time, it’s like **cooking**.

Using lots of spices.  
Experimenting.  
Trying new dishes.  
Making a lot of bad ones.

Because without trying, how would I ever know how bad I am at cooking, right?

## Final Thoughts

So that’s it.

I just wasted—or maybe **spent**—30 minutes writing this. I don’t know. I’m not a writer. And yes, I probably used ChatGPT to fix my grammar.

But staying true to myself is more important than pretending to chase someone else’s dream of being in the “top 1%”.

This year’s motivation is simple:

- Stay true to yourself  
- Keep losing  
- Keep coming back  
- Don’t hurt yourself too much  
- Enjoy the process  
- Take breaks (even long ones)  
- Try something else if you get overwhelmed  
- But **stay in the process**

All of this creates progress—once you start following **your own** dreams.
If you read this far, thank you.

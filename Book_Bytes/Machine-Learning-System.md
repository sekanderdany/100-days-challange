Summary:

Chapter 1: Introduction

AI is the what, the vision of intelligent machines that can learn, reason, and adapt.

Machine Learning (ML) represents the methodological approach and practical
discipline for creating systems that demonstrate intelligent behavior.

Consider the evolution of chess-playing systems as an example of this shift.
The AI goal remains constant: “Create a system that can play chess like a
human.” However, the approaches differ:

• Symbolic AI Approach (Pre-ML): Program the computer with all chess
rules and hand-craft strategies like “control the center” and “protect the
king.” This requires expert programmers to explicitly encode thousands
of chess principles, creating brittle systems that struggle with novel positions.
• Machine Learning Approach: Have the computer analyze millions of
chess games to learn winning strategies automatically from data. Rather
than programming specific moves, the system discovers patterns that
lead to victory through statistical analysis of game outcomes.

Definition: Machine Learning System
Machine Learning Systems are integrated computing systems comprising
three interdependent components: data that guides behavior, algorithms
that learn patterns, and computational infrastructure that enables both
training and inference.
